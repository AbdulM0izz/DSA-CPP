Why we use obeject oriented programming ?

In proceducer oriented programming we use high level language like c,cobol,fortan in past; Program was divied into tasks and that tasks groups into functions; We have the make data global that functions can access the data but this it is difficult to track which function change data to solve this problem OOP is come

We bind data to the function using it; oop protect data to accidental changes

 => Class {
    User defined data type
    Variables of the class are object
 }

 => Objects {
    Objects are variables type class
    And this variable have properties which are in class
 }

 => Constructor {
    Used to initialize an object
    this is a function which is called when object is created
    
    same name as class name
    types of constructors
    1 default {no paramter or arguments}
    2 parameterized
    3 copy constructor
 }

 => Destructor {
    it is a function called when object is deleted;

    we canot pass any paramter to destructor
 }
